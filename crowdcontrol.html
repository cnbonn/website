                Integrated group messaging is an important feature of Crowd Control. Integrated group messaging allows for communication between cross platform, different phone brands, and diﬀerent carriers. This allows for seamless communicaton between users with out the issues associated with messaging such as messages not using the same format, messages not going to all recipiants, and messages with users in the group that you do no want to have your personal information.

                    Suggestions are both a plus for the user and our way of making a monitary developement. Suggestions are sponsored by local busnesses in the form of an ad. Altough these are not traditional ads, they are in the form of local points of intrest such as restraunts, bars, amusement parks, or bowling alllys. The possibilities are endless. With the suggestion method it will allow for our users to have helpful suggestions of places for their group to attend as well as exposure for the local busnesses that are sponsering Crowd Control.
